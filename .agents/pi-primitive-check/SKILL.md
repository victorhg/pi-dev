# Pi Primitive Check

Use this before implementing speculative Pi customisation ideas. The
goal is to avoid building a parallel abstraction when Pi already has a
primitive.

## Workflow

1. Restate the underlying user need, separate from the proposed
   solution.
2. Search local Pi docs for overlapping primitives, especially
   commands, session features, SDK APIs, extension events, tools,
   skills, and TUI APIs.
3. Search this repo for existing built-ins and `packages/pi-*` that
   already address the need.
4. Classify the proposal:
   - use existing Pi primitive
   - document or wrap existing primitive
   - compose existing primitives
   - implement new feature
5. If overlap exists, pause and ask the user to confirm before coding.

## Required local sources

Read relevant files from the installed Pi docs before deciding:

- Main documentation: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/README.md`
- Additional docs: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/docs`
- Examples: `/opt/homebrew/lib/node_modules/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent/examples`

Prefer targeted `rg` over broad reading, then read the relevant docs
fully enough to verify behavior.

## Output format

```md
Primitive check:

- User need:
- Existing Pi primitives:
- Existing Pi customisation pieces:
- Overlap/risk:
- Recommendation:
- Confirm before build:
```

Keep the recommendation direct. If the answer is “do not build this”,
say so.
