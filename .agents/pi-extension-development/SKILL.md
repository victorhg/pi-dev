# Pi Extension Development

Use this workflow for `packages/pi-*` implementation work in this
repo.

## Workflow

1. Identify the package boundary first: root app, `src/extensions/*`,
   or a `packages/pi-*` workspace package.
2. For new built-ins, add a package under `packages/`, wire root
   `package.json` optional dependencies, and register in
   `src/extensions/builtin-registry.ts`.
3. Keep extension entrypoints small: export a default extension
   function and pure helper functions for testable trigger logic.
4. Put user-facing injected prompt text in one obvious template block;
   gate injection by selected tools/options when possible.
5. Update package README and Changeset when behavior changes.
6. Validate with the package script first, then root checks if
   registry/root files changed.

## Project conventions

- Prefer `@spences10/pi-*` workspace packages with `workspace:*`
  links.
- Tests live beside source as `*.test.ts` and should cover
  trigger/gating helpers.
- Avoid importing another package's `src/*` or `dist/*`; use public
  package entrypoints.
- Use `references/checklist.md` for the exact file checklist when
  adding a package.
